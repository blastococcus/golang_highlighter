## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You'll also need Flask and PLY, which are the main dependencies of the application.

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blastococcus/golang_highlighter.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd golang_highlighter
```
Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask ply
```
Running the Server


To start the application, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
flask run
```
This will start a development server at the default URL http://127.0.0.1:5000. Open this URL in your web browser to interact with the application.
